# ForMobileAppTesting-Checklist

### Functional Testing
- Functional testing is the basic testing activity that ensures that all the features of your app work as they should. It is fundamental to assess that your app functions        as expected across devices, OSes, and other variations.

You need to test...

- Sending and receiving messages with the app running.
- Responding to push notifications with the app running.
- Making and receiving calls with the app running.
- Resuming the app after an interruption.
- Rejecting calls with the app running.
- Entering and exiting the app.
- Memory used by the app.
- Your app’s effect on the device’s battery.
- Biometrics, like fingerprint and face ID.
- Functions like camera, screen resolution, and geolocation.


### Performance Testing
- Performance testing ensures that your app performs as it should in different circumstances. It also makes sure these functions work under different types of conditions.

Performance testing includes testing...

- Your app under typical levels of traffic.
- Your app with stress/load levels of traffic.
- Your app with real user conditions.
- The CPU utilization of your app.
- The timeto install and uninstall the app.
- The time to launch the app.
- App performance during low battery.
- App performance under varying network conditions. These include:
- Ideal network conditions.
- Poor connectivity.
- Changing network while moving.
- Dead zones.
- Switching between 2G, 3G, 4G, and 5G.


### Accessibility Testing
- Don’t forget accessibility testing for your mobile apps. Not only does it make your app accessible to all users — it’s also the law. Violating accessibility regulations could result in big fines.

In your automated accessibility testing, be sure to test...

- Text color contrast.
- Screen magnification.
- Dynamic font size.
- Color ratios between text and background.
- Screen reader compatibility.
- Readability of the application.
- Speech recognition capability.
- UI hierarchy for consistent structure.
- Labels used by assistive technologies, like VoiceOver or TalkBack.
- Hit area size for designated user interaction.

### Usability/UX Testing
- Usability testing, or UX testing, measures how user-friendly and intuitive your app is. Usability testing can reveal problems in the mobile UX design which impact the end user experience.

Usability testing should include…

- Testing the app when changing the screen orientation.
- Testing the navigation of the app.
- Testing the mobile menu of the app.
- Testing visual feedback for user interactions.
- 
#Compatibility Testing
- Compatibility testing ensures that your mobile app works across different devices, OSes, and generations. Given the fragmented nature of the mobile landscape, prioritize testing against the most popular mobile devices and OSes in your region. You can find that data in our Test Coverage Index.

Be sure to test...

- Screen size.
- Screen resolution.
- Device-specific features.
- OS-specific features.
- Changes in the UI.

### Security Testing
- Users want to know that their digital experiences are secure, and that’s where security testing comes in. Security testing ensures that sensitive information and data remain safe.

In your security testing, test for…

- Two-factor authentication.
- Fingerprint and face ID.
- Proper storage of app data and private information.
- Proper encryption of information stored locally on the device.
